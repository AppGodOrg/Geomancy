    <h3>What do these figures mean?</h3>
    <h4>The Mothers</h4>
    <p>
      <em>The mothers represent the causes of the answer.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The four mothers are the source of the rest of the figures.
      They are the only figures that are generated by a randomized process.
      The rest of the figures are generated from an analysis of the four mothers.
    </p>
    <h4>The Daughters</h4>
    <p>
      <em>The daughters represent the effects of the answer.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The four daughters are generated from the four mothers.
      The first daughter is generated by combining the first rows of each of the four mothers.
      The second daughter is generated by combining the second rows of each of the four mothers. And so on.
    </p>
    <h4>The Nephews</h4>
    <p>
      <em>The nephews represent a summary of the causes and effects of the answer.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The nephews are generated from adding the mothers and daughters in groups of two.
      Adding two tetragrams is done by adding each of their rows.
      If the rows are the same, their sum is two dots. If they are not the same, their sum is one dot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first nephew is generated by adding the first and second mother. The second nephew is generated by adding the third and fourth mother. The third nephew is generated by adding the first and second daughter. The fourth nephew is generated by adding the third and fourth daughter.
    </p>
    <h4>The Witnesses</h4>
    <p>
      <em>The right witness represents a summary of how the answer will begin.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The left witness represents a summary of how the answer will end.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The two witnesses are generated by adding the nephews together in the same way the nephews were generated.
      That is, the right witness is generated by adding the first and second nephew, and the left witness is generated by adding the third and fourth nephew. 
    </p>
    <h4>The Judge</h4>
    <p>
      <em>The judge represents a summary of the entire reading.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge is generated by adding the two witnesses together.
    </p>
    <h4>The Reconciler</h4>
    <p>
      <em>The reconciler represents a second opinion of the judgement.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The reconciler is generated by adding the judge with the first mother. It should only be considered when the judgement is unclear.
