      <h2>Welcome to <b>Geomancy</b></h2>
      <p>
        <b>Geomancy</b> ("earth divination") is a method of divination that interprets markings on the ground or the patterns formed by tossed handfuls of soil, rocks, or sand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most prevalent form of <b>geomancy</b> involves interpreting a series of 16 figures formed by a randomized process that involves recursion followed by analyzing them, often augmented with astrological interpretations.

      <h2>A little bit of history</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Geomancy</b> was one of the most popular forms of divination throughout Africa and Europe, particularly during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  It was practiced by people from all social classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Renaissance magic, <b>geomancy</b> was classified as one of the seven "forbidden arts", along with necromancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, pyromancy, chiromancy (palmistry), and spatulamancy (scapulimancy).
